## Combinational Logic Optimization

### Objective:
- Squeeze and simplify logic to get the most optimized design in terms of area and power.

### Techniques:

- #### Constant Propagation:
 - Replaces logic blocks with constants when input values are fixed.
- #### Boolean Logic Optimization:
 - Simplify Boolean expressions using: Karnaugh Map (K-Map) and Quine McCluskey Method
