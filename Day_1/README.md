# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

### *SKY130RTL D1SK1 L1 Introduction to iverilog design and test bench*
### Simulator
- A simulator is a software tool that checks your digital circuitâ€™s functionality by applying test inputs and viewing outputs. This helps you verify your design before hardware implementation.
- Simulator is tool used for simulate your design.
- In Day 1, we are using open source simulator iverilog.
- Stimulator is looking for the change in the values of input.
- Output of the stimulator is the vcd file.

### Design 
- Design is the set of verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet the specific requirements.

### Test Bench 
- It is setup to apply stimulus to the design to check its functionality.
- Test Bench doesn't have a Primary input or outputs.
- Note, only the design has its Primary input or outputs.

### GTKWave
- It is used for viewing the waveform.

After  cloning the git

```bash
ls
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
ls
# To dump the vcd file
. /a.out
```
If you want to change the desgin
```bash
gvim tb_good_mux.v -o good_mux.v
```
